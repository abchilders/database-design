Scenario selection: Loving Care Pet Boarding 

Some questions people might ask in this scenario:
1.) How many people are enrolled in X pet training class?
2.) When do we expect dog Y to be picked up from daycare by their owner? 
3.) Which volunteers are trained to handle cats?    
4.) What are the qualifications/training of our paid employees?  
5.) In case of an emergency, what are the phone numbers of cat Z's owner?

Business rules:
1.) Unless otherwise allowed by a class instructor, there may only be up
	to 15 people enrolled in any given pet training class at a time. 
2.) Volunteers must be trained to handle cats and/or dogs before they can 
	walk and play with them. 
3.) Owners may specify special needs for each pet when they are making an
	appointment for their pet (e.g. administering medication, 
	grooming instructions), but this is optional.
