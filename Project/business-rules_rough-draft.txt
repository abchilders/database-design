Business rules (ROUGH DRAFT): 
* Unless otherwise allowed by a class instructor, there may only	
be up to 15 people enrolled in any given pet training class at a 
time. 

* Volunteers must be trained to handle cats and/or dogs before 
they can walk and play with them. 

* Owners may specify special needs for each pet when they are 
making an appointment for their pet (e.g. administering 
medication, grooming instructions), but this is optional. 

Now for some imaginative creative writing: 

* Loving Care Pet Boarding takes Pets: Cats and Dogs
.
* Cats and Dogs are booked into boarding by Owners. 

* In boarding, these Pets are given good exercise and plenty of 
attention: 
	* Every day, Dogs are walked/played with twice and get groomed once. 
	* Cats are given two playtimes (for exercise) and get groomed once.  
	* Volunteers may walk dogs, play with dogs, groom dogs, play with cats,
	 	or groom cats. 
	* Boarding is billed by the full day / half day: $30 per day, 
	$15 if picked up before 12 pm or dropped off after 12 pm.
	* Pets must have vaccines and be spayed/neutered to be in boarding.  
	
* In doggy day care, Dogs are dropped off while the Owners are at 
work. 
	* Dogs in doggy day care can only stay during that one 
	day's business hours: 8 am - 6 pm every day.
	* Doggy day care is billed by how long they stay: half a 
	day (5 hours or less) is $10; more than 5 hours is $20. 
	* If Dogs are picked up late (between 6 and 8), there is a charge of $5. 
	* If they are left overnight, there is a charge of at least $15 (as if 
	left overnight for a half day of boarding.) 
	* While Dogs are in doggy day care, they get exercise and 
	attention, same as in boarding, as well as nap times. 
	* Reservations are welcome, as well as drop-in if there is
	space. Doggy day care can hold up to 30 dogs a day. 
	* Dogs must have vaccines and be spayed/neutered to be in doggy day care.

 * Owners attend classes with or without their Pet. 
	* Each class is taught by one or more paid Employees. 
	* Classes are generally taught for 6-week periods, one hour per week. 
	* Owners must sign up ahead of time. 
	* There can be up to 15 Owners (and their one Pet if required) at a time
	in a class, unless otherwise permitted by the instructor. 

* Employees are paid to work at Loving Care Pet Boarding. 
	* Employees therefore have a salary.
	* They may be receptionists, veterinarians, or attendants. 
	* Depending on their job title, they might have appropriate training
	or licensing. (e.g. attendants have basic training in working with cats
	and dogs, or a veterinarian has a license in veterinary
	medicine)
	* Employees work in 8 hour shifts: 22:00-06:00, 06:00-14:00, 
	14:00 - 20:00 
	* Receptionists work on billing and office work - they should, at least,
	know how to handle pets, though. (Should they be required to have pet
	training too? Is a receptionist just a specific type of attendant?) 
	* Veterinarians work on all services for all pets.
	* Attendants work on boarding and daycare services. 
	* Teachers work on pet classes. 
* Volunteers come and go as they please.
	* They must be trained to help with walking and playing with Cats or
	Dogs before they can assist with them. 
	* Once they are trained, Volunteers may do exercising/playing or 
	grooming duties for a pet.  
	* Volunteers provide their name, email address, and phone number 
	upon signing up. 

* Idea: Use an Account to keep track of Transactions? NOPE
	* Is salary even a relevant thing here? "employees are well cared for"-
	what does this entail? 
	* Do we care about when the employee works and how much they make, or 
	do we only care about the services they can provide...?
