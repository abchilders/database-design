Problem 2 part a
-----------------
The posted SQL style standard that specifically applies to SELECT statement
ORDER BY clauses: 

"THOU SHALT only use ORDER BY clauses for an outermost SELECT (not within any
sub-selects), and it shall be indented to make clear that it "belongs" to the 
outermost SELECT." 

Problem 2 part b
-----------------
The posted SQL style standard that specifically applies to SELECT statement
GROUP BY clauses:

"THOU SHALT" only use GROUP BY clauses when one has a good reason (usually a 
computation that you wish done to those groups)."

Problem 2 part c 
-----------------
The posted SQL style standard that applies to any nested SELECT statement:

"THOU SHALT surround each nested select statement with a set of parentheses
()."  

Problem 2 part d
-----------------
The two posted SQL style standards that apply specifically to the EXISTS and 
NOT EXISTS predicates: 

"When using EXISTS or NOT EXISTS
	- its sub-select argument is EXPECTED to include an appropriate 
	  correlation condition
	- its sub-select argument is EXPECTED to project a literal (since
	  these predicates only "care" if any rows exist in that sub-select's
	  results, NOT those rows' contents, and why bother doing much work 
	  projecting those contents, then?)"
